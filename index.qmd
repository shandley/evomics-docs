Master the command line for genomic data analysis. From basic navigation to advanced bioinformatics workflows, this guide transforms wet lab biologists into computational powerhouses.

## What Makes This Different

**Biology-First Approach**
Every example uses real genomic data. No toy datasets. FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, VCF files from actual research.

**Modern Toolchain**
Beyond grep and awk. Learn bioawk, seqtk, csvtk, parallel processing, and modern bioinformatics utilities.

**Beginner to Expert**
Start with pwd and ls. End with automated pipelines processing thousands of samples on HPC clusters.

**Interactive Practice**
Every concept links to hands-on exercises on [Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org) with instant feedback.

## Who This Guide Is For

```bash
$ cat audience.txt
```

- Biology graduate students starting computational work
- Wet lab biologists moving into bioinformatics
- Bioinformaticians leveling up command-line skills
- Anyone working with genomic data on UNIX/Linux

No programming experience required. Familiarity with basic biology assumed.

## Learning Path

This guide is organized into progressively advanced sections:

**Foundations**
Essential commands and concepts. File systems, permissions, basic text manipulation.

**Text Processing Mastery**
grep, sed, awk, and modern alternatives. Build powerful command pipelines.

**Biological Applications**
FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, VCF formats. Optimize performance for large datasets.

**Advanced Topics**
HPC cluster workflows, bash scripting, automation, parallel processing.

**Reference**
Curated one-liners library and troubleshooting guide.

This guide is one component of a multi-modal learning system:

- **[Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org)** - Interactive terminal with instant feedback
- **This Guide** - Comprehensive reference and advanced techniques
- **[R for Biologists](https://github.com/shandley/r-tidyverse-for-biologists)** - R programming course

Alternate between reading and practicing for optimal learning.

## Prerequisites

```bash
$ which terminal
```

Access to a UNIX/Linux terminal:

- **macOS**: Terminal app (pre-installed)
- **Linux**: Terminal/bash (pre-installed)
- **Windows**: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Cloud**: [Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org/terminal) (no installation)

That's it. Everything else is covered in this guide.
