# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to **UNIX for Biologists**, a comprehensive guide to mastering the command line for genomic data analysis.

## About This Guide

This guide teaches UNIX and command-line skills specifically for biologists and bioinformaticians. Whether you're analyzing RNA-seq data, processing genome assemblies, or working with variant calls, the command line is an essential tool in modern biological research.

**What makes this guide different:**

- **Biology-first examples** - Every concept illustrated with real genomic data
- **Beginner to expert** - Start with basics, progress to advanced techniques
- **Practical workflows** - Real bioinformatics pipelines, not toy examples
- **Modern tools** - Beyond grep/awk to bioawk, seqtk, parallel processing
- **HPC cluster skills** - Working on remote servers and batch systems
- **Integrated learning** - Links to interactive exercises on [Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org)

## Who This Guide Is For

- **Biology graduate students** starting computational work
- **Wet lab biologists** moving into bioinformatics
- **Bioinformaticians** looking to level up their command-line skills
- **Anyone** working with genomic data on UNIX/Linux systems

No programming experience required, though familiarity with basic biology and genetics is assumed.

## Learning Path

This guide is organized into progressively advanced sections:

**Foundations** - Learn the essential commands and concepts. Understand file systems, permissions, and basic text manipulation.

**Text Processing Mastery** - Master grep, sed, awk, and modern alternatives. Learn to build powerful command pipelines.

**Biological Applications** - Work with FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, VCF, and other genomic file formats. Optimize performance for large datasets.

**Advanced Topics** - HPC cluster workflows, bash scripting, automation, and parallel processing.

**Reference** - Curated one-liners library and troubleshooting guide.

## Interactive Practice

This guide is part of the **Evomics Learning Ecosystem**:

- **[Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org)** - Interactive terminal exercises with instant feedback
- **This Guide** - Comprehensive reference and advanced techniques
- **[R for Biologists](https://github.com/shandley/r-tidyverse-for-biologists)** - Complementary R programming course

We recommend alternating between reading this guide and practicing on the interactive platform.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a UNIX/Linux terminal:
  - **macOS**: Terminal app (already installed)
  - **Linux**: Terminal/bash (already installed)
  - **Windows**: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
  - **Cloud**: [Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org/terminal) (no installation needed!)

That's it! Everything else will be covered in this guide.

## How to Use This Guide

**If you're a complete beginner:**

1. Start with [Chapter 1: Foundations](chapters/01-foundations.qmd)
2. Practice each concept on [Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org/terminal)
3. Work through chapters sequentially
4. Complete exercises before moving forward

**If you have some experience:**

- Jump to specific chapters that interest you
- Use the [One-Liners Library](chapters/09-oneliners.qmd) as a quick reference
- Explore [Power Tools](chapters/04-power-tools.qmd) for modern alternatives

**If you're advanced:**

- Focus on [HPC Clusters](chapters/07-hpc-clusters.qmd) and [Scripting](chapters/08-scripting.qmd)
- Check out lesser-known tools in [Power Tools](chapters/04-power-tools.qmd)
- Use [One-Liners](chapters/09-oneliners.qmd) to optimize your workflows
