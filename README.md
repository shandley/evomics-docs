## About

This is a Quarto book teaching UNIX and command-line skills specifically for biologists and bioinformaticians. From basic navigation to advanced scripting, this guide covers everything you need to analyze genomic data on the command line.

## What's Inside

- **Foundations** - Essential UNIX concepts and navigation
- **Text Processing** - grep, sed, awk, and modern alternatives
- **Biological Applications** - Working with FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, VCF files
- **HPC Clusters** - Remote work and job scheduling
- **Scripting & Automation** - Bash scripting for reproducible workflows
- **One-Liners Library** - Curated collection of powerful command combinations
- **Appendices** - Cheat sheets, regex guide, file format reference

## Features

- Biology-focused examples throughout
- Links to interactive exercises on [Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org)
- Modern tools (bioawk, seqtk, csvtk, parallel, pigz)
- Real bioinformatics workflows
- Beginner to advanced progression
- Multiple output formats (HTML, PDF)
