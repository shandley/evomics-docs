# UNIX for Biologists

**Command-Line Genomics from Beginner to Expert**

Master the command line for genomic data analysis. From basic navigation to advanced bioinformatics workflows, this guide transforms wet lab biologists into computational powerhouses.

## Overview

This comprehensive guide teaches UNIX/Linux command-line skills specifically for biologists working with genomic data. Every example uses real biological data formats (FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, VCF) from actual research scenarios.

## Features

- **Biology-First Approach**: All examples use real genomic data, not toy datasets
- **Modern Toolchain**: Beyond grep and awk - learn bioawk, seqtk, csvtk, parallel processing
- **Beginner to Expert**: Start with pwd/ls, end with automated HPC pipelines
- **Interactive Practice**: Links to hands-on exercises on [Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org)

## Who This Guide Is For

- Biology graduate students starting computational work
- Wet lab biologists moving into bioinformatics
- Bioinformaticians leveling up command-line skills
- Anyone working with genomic data on UNIX/Linux

No programming experience required. Familiarity with basic biology assumed.

## Content Structure
