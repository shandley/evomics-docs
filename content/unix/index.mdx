Welcome to **UNIX for Biologists**! This comprehensive guide teaches you the command-line skills essential for modern bioinformatics.

## What You'll Learn

This guide takes you from complete beginner to advanced user, covering:

- Essential UNIX commands and concepts
- Text processing with grep, sed, and awk
- Working with biological file formats (FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, VCF)
- Building automated bioinformatics workflows
- HPC cluster computing and parallel processing

## Why UNIX for Bioinformatics?

Modern biology generates massive datasets. A single RNA-seq experiment produces hundreds of millions of sequencing reads. Whole genome sequencing generates gigabytes of data. You cannot point-and-click your way through terabytes of genomic data.

The UNIX command line is the universal interface for bioinformatics because it:

- **Scales effortlessly** - Process one file or ten thousand with the same commands
- **Automates repetitive tasks** - Script once, run on every sample
- **Works remotely** - Control HPC clusters from anywhere
- **Chains operations** - Combine simple tools into powerful workflows
- **Handles any file size** - Process files larger than your computer's memory

## Prerequisites

You need access to a UNIX/Linux terminal:

- **macOS**: Terminal app (pre-installed)
- **Linux**: Terminal/bash (pre-installed)
- **Windows**: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Cloud**: [Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org/terminal) (no installation)

No programming experience required. Familiarity with basic biology assumed.

## Interactive Practice

Every chapter links to hands-on exercises on **[Evomics Learn](https://learn.evomics.org/terminal)** with instant feedback. Alternate between reading and practicing for optimal learning.
