# R for Biologists

**Modern Data Analysis and Visualization with the Tidyverse**

Master R programming for biological data analysis. From data wrangling to publication-quality visualizations, this guide provides quick-reference documentation for the tidyverse ecosystem.

## About This Guide

This is a **reference guide** focused on concepts, syntax, and workflows. For comprehensive interactive learning with exercises and homework, see our [full 18-lesson course](https://github.com/shandley/r-tidyverse-for-biologists).

**Best used for**:
- Quick syntax lookup
- Function reference
- Workflow examples
- Biological use cases

**Not a replacement for**:
- Interactive practice (use the full course)
- Beginner tutorials (start with the course)
- Hands-on exercises (see the course)

## Learning Path

<Callout type="info" title="New to R?">
**Start with the full course**: [R and Tidyverse for Biology Graduate Students](https://github.com/shandley/r-tidyverse-for-biologists)

The 18-lesson interactive course provides structured learning from basics to advanced topics, with hands-on exercises designed for posit.cloud.

Once you're comfortable with R, use this reference guide for quick lookups and workflow examples.

**For experienced R users**:
- Jump to specific topics using the sidebar
- Reference function syntax
- Copy workflow examples for your analyses

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of biological concepts
- Access to R and RStudio (local install or posit.cloud)
- Familiarity with data frames and basic programming (helpful but not required)

## The Tidyverse Ecosystem

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science with a consistent philosophy and grammar:

- **dplyr**: Data manipulation
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization
- **tidyr**: Data reshaping
- **readr**: Data import
- **purrr**: Functional programming
- **stringr**: String manipulation
- **lubridate**: Date/time handling

All designed to work together seamlessly with the pipe operator `%>%` (or `|>`).

## Philosophy

This guide emphasizes:

1. **Tidyverse-first**: Modern R syntax over base R when possible
2. **Real biology**: Examples use actual biological datasets
3. **Practical workflows**: Copy-paste-adapt for your research
4. **Quick reference**: Fast lookups over comprehensive tutorials
5. **Reproducibility**: All code runs independently
